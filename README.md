### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The colour palette was generated from the Tasked logo using [coolors](https://coolors.co/).

![Tasked colour palette](documentation/readme/tasked-colour-palette.png)

- `#000000` has been used to add a gentle shadow to the primary buttons.
- `#1E252A` has been used as the main text colour.
- `#1E4185` has been used to provide a contrast when links are hovered over.
- `#376153` has been used as a contrast when the primary buttons are hovered over.
- `#67D09F` has been used as the background colour for the navbar and for the primary buttons, to match the Tasked branding.
- `#AC524B` has been used as a secondary colour on the navbar and for the labels on the tasks, to match the Tasked branding.
- `#D7DDE9` has been used as the background colour to provide contrast to the containers.
- `#FFFFFF` has been used as the background colour for the containers across the app, and as the text colour on the task labels to provide contrast.

#### Typeography

- `Fredoka` with a fallback font of `italic` has been used for the main headings, to match the font in the Tasked logo.

- `Raleway` with a fallback font of `italic` has been used for the remaining elements. 

Both of the fonts above were obtained from the Google Fonts library.

## Testing

All testing details are documented within the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Agile Development Process

The Tasked app was developed using an Agile approach.

- User stories were prioritised using the MoSCoW method:

| Priority Level | Description  |
|---|---|
| `must-have ` | Essential features  |
| `should-have` | Important but not absolutely essential features  |
| `could-have ` | Nice to have but not essential features  |
| `won't-have`  | Non essential features, may be implemented in the future |

- GitHub Issues was used to document & to prioritise each of the user stories.

![GitHub Issues must have user stories](documentation/readme/github-issues-must-have.PNG)
![GitHub Issues should have user stories](documentation/readme/github-issues-should-have.PNG)
![GitHub Issues could have user stories](documentation/readme/github-issues-could-have.PNG)
![GitHub Issues won't have user stories](documentation/readme/github-issues-wont-have.PNG)

- The user stories were refined & actioned in 4 different iterations: 

| Iteration | Screenshot |
|---|---|
| Iteration 1: Navigation, Authentication & Tasks  | ![GitHub milestone - Iteration 1](documentation/readme/github-milestone-iteration-1.PNG)  |
| Iteration 2: Task Comments & Profiles  | ![GitHub milestone - Iteration 2](documentation/readme/github-milestone-iteration-2.PNG)  | 
| Iteration 3: Task Features  | ![GitHub milestone - Iteration 3](documentation/readme/github-milestone-iteration-3.PNG)  | 
| Iteration 4: App features & statistics  | ![GitHub milestone - Iteration 4](documentation/readme/github-milestone-iteration-4.PNG)  | 

A [GitHub project](https://github.com/users/akirby23/projects/7/views/1) was used to manage & track the progress of the app's development:

## Deployment

Tasked has been deployed to Heroku. Click [here](https://tasked-pp5-f085ebbd00be.herokuapp.com/) to view the live link. 

The steps below can be followed to deploy the application:

### Fork or clone the Tasked repository

#### Forking the repository

1. Navigate to [Tasked GitHub repository](https://github.com/akirby23/tasked).
2. At the top right-hand corner of the page, click on "Fork".
3. Rename or change the description if you wish.
4. Click "Create Fork".
5. A copy of the original repository should now appear on your GitHub account.

#### Cloning the repository

1. Navigate to [Tasked GitHub repository](https://github.com/akirby23/tasked).
2. Navigate to the "<> Code" button and click on it.
3. Choose your preferred cloning option (HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI).
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. In your terminal, enter the following command to clone The Crochet Corner repository:
     ``git clone https://github.com/akirby23/tasked.git``
7. Press enter to create a local clone in your preferred IDE.

### Update your axios base URL 

1. In your repository, navigate to ``src/api/axiosDefaults.js``. 
2. Replace the current axios.defaults.baseURL with your own deployed API URL.
    1. This can be found by navigating to your Heroku dashboard, clicking on your deployed API's app name, clicking on "Open App" at the top of the page and copying the app's url.

### Create the app
1. Create a Heroku account on [heroku.com](https://heroku.com/)
2. From the top right hand corner of the dashboard, click "New", then click "Create new app".
3. Give the app a unique name and select the relevant region.
4. Click "Create app".

### Deploy to Heroku

- Navigate to the "Deploy" tab. 
- Link the GitHub repository in the Deployment Method sectionn. 
- Deploy manually or enable automatic deploys if you would prefer. 
- If any errors occur during deployment, the build logs can be used to troubleshoot them.

The app will now be live.
